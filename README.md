Project Overview

This project is a **Quiz-Based Puzzle Game** in Python. The main goal of this project is to create an entertaining, interactive application where users can test their General Knowledge (GK).

It is a GUI Game, meaning it consists of buttons, labels, and pop-up windows, which will be very easy for everybody to use. The topics covered include Geography, Science, History, and General Facts.
## 2. Why this Project?
* **To learn Python GUI:** To comprehend how `tkinter` works for developing desktop applications.

* **Logic Building:** Understanding how to store questions, check answers, and calculate scores using code.

* **User Interaction:** To learn how to handle button clicks and show result messages.

3. Features of the Project
This game comes with the following cool features:
* **3 Difficulty levels:
* **Easy:** Simple questions for complete beginners.
* **Medium:** Somewhat challenging.
* **Hard:** Difficult questions to really challenge your brain.
* **Variety of Topics:** Includes questions involving capitals, science, planets, and history.

* Score Counter: The game will count your marks automatically. Each correct answer gives you +1.

* **Instant Feedback:** As soon as you click an answer, a pop-up box tells you if you are "Correct" or "Wrong".

* **Final Scorecard:** At the end of the quiz, it shows your total marks out of 10 with a motivational message.

4. Technologies and Tools Used

You don't need any heavy software to run this. We used standard tools:
1.  **Python:** Primary programming language to be used. Python 3.x is recommended.
2.  **Tkinter:** This is a Python library that is used to design the window, buttons, and text.
3.  **VS Code / IDLE:** Any code editor for writing and running the script.

## 5. Project Structure (How the Code Works)

The code is divided into simple parts:

* **The Data (Dictionary):** All the questions are in a variable called `quizStuff`. It's like a little database in the program.

* **Functions:**
* `home_screen()`: Displays the Start button.
* `pick_diff()`: Allows the user to choose Easy, Medium, or Hard. * `show_q()`: Displays the question and 4 options on screen. * `verify()`: Verifies whether the clicked button is the correct answer. * `end_screen()`: Displays the outcome.
