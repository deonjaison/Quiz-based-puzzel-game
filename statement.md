# Project Statement: Quiz Based Puzzel Game

## 1. Problem Statement
Traditional modes of learning and quizzing utilize a pen-and-paper test or static textbooks to check one's General Knowledge. This can be:
* It is boring to view.
* **Slow:** The students have to wait for a teacher to check answers in order to know their score.

* **Wasteful:** Paper-based quizzes waste resources.

Therefore, there is a need for an electronic, interactive solution that enables users to instantly test their knowledge, receive immediate feedback, and chart their performance in a fun and engaging way without the need for an active connection to the internet.

2. Project Scope
The **Quiz Master** project is a desktop-based application designed to simulate a real-world quiz environment.
**In-scope: What the Project Includes:
* **Platform:** It is a standalone desktop application which runs on Windows/Linux/MacOS using Python.

* **Content:** It contains a built-in database of questions covering different topics: History, Science, Geography.
It takes care of the answer verification, score calculation, and screen navigation.
* **Interface:** A GUI that uses buttons and labels for easy interaction.

What the project does not include:
* It does not require an internet connection.
It does not have online multiplayer features.
* It does not use an external database server like SQL; data is stored locally, directly in the code.

## 3. Target Users
This application is useful for:
* **Students:** Those who want to improve their General Knowledge for exams or competition.
Teachers/Tutors: Those who want an entertaining tool in engaging their students in a computer laboratory session.
